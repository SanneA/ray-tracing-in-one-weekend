<h2> Overview </h2>
C++ implementation of the Ray Tracer described in the book Ray Tracer in One Weekend by Peter Shirley.
The book is free and available here: http://www.realtimerendering.com/#books-small-table

<h2> Main features </h2>
The ray tracer, even if relatively simple, implements some advanced features. Namely: reflection, refraction and basic indirect lighing.<br/>
This implementation can represents spheres of three different materials (Lambertian, Dielectric and Metal). The Blur feature described in the book is not implemented. 

<h2> TODO: </h2>
* Parallel computing to speed up the ray-object intersection.<br/>
* Blur features<br/>
<br/>
For a more complex ray tracer, please refer to the repository ray-tracing-next-week.
